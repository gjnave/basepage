BasePage is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) that converts web-pages to base64.
In essence: it takes all external resources on a page (image, video, audio) and returns them all as one single file.  Instead of a folder with subfolders, a single index.html

***WARNING**** 
This application should be used with a
VPN or a Proxy server to avoid potentially
getting your IP blocked by certain sites
**********
This index.html file can the be sent via email, displayed on a website, or wheverever else is needed, without having to recreate the page or ascertain all external links

Installation:
1. install.bat
2. run
3. paste url
4. open index.html in browser

Simple
